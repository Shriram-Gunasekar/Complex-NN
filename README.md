# Complex-NN

This repository focuses on implementing neural networks using non-real numbers, specifically Grassmann numbers, complex numbers, octonions, and quaternions. These alternative number systems offer unique properties that can be leveraged in neural network architectures for various applications. The repository provides implementations of neural networks using each of these non-real number systems and includes example usage and applications.

Key Features:

    Implementation of neural networks using Grassmann numbers, complex numbers, octonions, and quaternions.
    Grassman and Quartnernions and Octonions have separate files
    One each for creation of operations
    One each for creation of the network.
    Use appropriate imports
